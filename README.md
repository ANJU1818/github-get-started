4. Add the changes to the github with `git add`, `git commit`:

    ```bash

    Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

7. Wait until Zerobot or one of the maintainers merges your pull request. If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.

8. If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. For that follow the steps below.

	```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Sunera-2216/github-get-started.git
    git pull upstream master
    ```
